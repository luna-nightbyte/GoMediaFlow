# GoStreamer
This is a project ment to go hand-in-hand with my [fork](https://github.com/luna-nightbyte/Deep-Batch-Swapper) of [Deep-Live-cam](https://github.com/hacksider/Deep-Live-Cam). The [initial](https://github.com/luna-nightbyte/goStreamer/tree/7a11960a2febc5066cbff2745f5e0d338cb6b8b2) commit was tested and worked to simply send the webcam feed to a server running live [face-swapping](https://github.com/luna-nightbyte/Deep-Batch-Swapper/tree/02a9efdb34db5b890efe05ccb176e258cb9d6b8e). 

I'm not planning to work heavily on integrating it with the main repo, but rather my own [fork](https://github.com/luna-nightbyte/Deep-Batch-Swapper) where im using no-UI anyways.
